Project Description: Future Ad Click Prediction - Support Vector Machine Analysis of Social Network Ads
# In this project, the objective is to predict future ad clicks using Support Vector Machine (SVM) analysis on social network ads data. SVM is a powerful machine learning algorithm that can handle both linear and non-linear classification tasks, making it suitable for predicting binary outcomes like ad clicks based on various features.
